            <p class="description">
              This Cuban bread recipe uses lard and a double hit of yeast plus a
              fermented starter. All of this adds extra flavor and lift. I
              didn't think I liked Cuban sandwiches until I had one on real
              Cuban bread (pan Cubano) — what a difference! If you want to keep
              your starter going, reserve 1/4 cup of it before adding the rest
              to the dough.

            <h3 class="title">Directions</h3>
            <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Combine 1/2 cup warm water, 1/2 cup flour, and 1/2 teaspoon yeast,
              in a bowl or measuring cup. Whisk the starter until well blended.
              Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Place 1 package yeast and 2 teaspoons sugar in a mixing bowl. Pour
              in 3/4 cup warm water. Let rest 15 minutes to ensure yeast is
              alive and bubbling on the surface. Add lard and salt to bowl, then
              add 1 cup of the flour. Mix until incorporated and dough forms a
              sticky ball. Add the starter. Add all but 1/2 cup of the remaining
              flour and mix to incorporate.
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 3</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Knead dough on a lightly floured work surface until it comes
              together in a firm ball, adding up to 1/2 cup of the remaining
              flour as needed. Dough should be soft and supple with just a bit
              of tackiness on the surface.
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 4</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Place dough in a bowl and coat the surface with vegetable oil.
              Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and place in a warm spot
              to rise. Let rise until at least doubled in size, about 2 hours.
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 5</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and sprinkle
              with cornmeal.
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 6</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Lightly press dough
              into a rectangle with lightly floured hands. Divide dough in half
              and shape each half into a rectangle about 12 inches long and 1/2
              inch thick. Starting at the long ends, tightly roll dough to form
              two skinny loaves. Slightly flatten the tops. Transfer loaves to a
              prepared baking sheet and dust with flour. Cover with a light, dry
              towel and let rise until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 7</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut a 1/4-inch
              deep slit down the top of loaves with a sharp knife or razor.
              Lightly mist loaves with water.
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 8</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Bake in the preheated oven, one pan on the lower rack and one on
              the higher rack, for 10 minutes. Switch pan positions and continue
              to bake until loaves are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 9</b></p>
            <p class="directions">
              Transfer loaves to cooling rack and let cool to room temperature
              before slicing.
